## Verifying the Release
In order to verify the release, you'll need to have gpg or gpg2 installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MostroP2P/mostro/main/keys/negrunch.asc | gpg --import
```
Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming manifest.txt.sig and manifest.txt are in the current directory) with:
```bash
gpg --verify manifest.txt.sig manifest.txt

gpg: Firmado el jue 03 ago 2023 15:07:05 -03
gpg:                usando RSA clave 1E41631D137BA2ADE55344F73852B843679AD6F0
gpg: Firma correcta de "Francisco Calder√≥n <fjcalderon@gmail.com>" [absoluta]

```
That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the sha256 hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 <filename>`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match exactly.
